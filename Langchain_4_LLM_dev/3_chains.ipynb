As the temperature increases, the peak intensity of the radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths, resulting in a change in color from red to orange, yellow, white, and eventually blue at very high temperatures.\\n\\nBlack body radiation is a fundamental concept in physics and has significant applications in various fields, including astrophysics, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. It played a crucial role in the development of quantum theory and understanding the behavior of light and matter.'"
